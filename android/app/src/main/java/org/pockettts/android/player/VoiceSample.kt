/**
 * Plays a few seconds of a voice, so it can be chosen by ear rather than by name.
 *
 * The sample is the voice's own reference audio, not a synthesised sentence.
 * That is not a shortcut: in Pocket TTS a voice *is* a few seconds of reference
 * audio the model conditions on, so this is the most direct answer to "what does
 * this one sound like". It also means a sample costs nothing but the prompt
 * download - no 98 MB model bundle, no inference, no waiting - and works on a
 * fresh install before the model has ever been fetched. The download it does is
 * the same one selecting the voice would trigger later, so browsing by ear warms
 * the cache instead of duplicating work.
 *
 * The trade-off is honest to state: this is the raw prompt, so it carries the
 * recording's own room and pacing. The synthesised voice tracks its timbre
 * closely, which is the thing being chosen, but not its background.
