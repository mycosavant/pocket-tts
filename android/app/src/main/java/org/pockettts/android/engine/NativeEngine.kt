/**
 * pocket-speak's engine, the Rust crate the desk CLI runs, over JNI.
 *
 * `rust/crates/android` builds `libpocket_tts_jni.so`; ONNX Runtime is
 * Microsoft's `onnxruntime-android`, loaded first so the Rust side can open it
 * by name. One instance per process, never closed: [PocketTts] holds it for
 * the process's life. Synthesis is serialised by [PocketTts]; the native side
 * also locks the engine, which is what keeps a voice load from overlapping a
 * synthesis. A [CancelToken] may be cancelled from any thread.
