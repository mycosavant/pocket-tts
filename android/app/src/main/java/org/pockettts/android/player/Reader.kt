     * Synthesis runs ahead of playback. The engine composes a whole chunk
     * before it emits a sample - every frame of the language model, then the
     * decoder - so a chunk's audio arrives all at once, after a silence as
     * long as the model took. Feeding the sink from inside the engine's
     * callback, as this used to, meant the next chunk could not begin until
     * this one had been *heard*: the blocking write held the callback, the
     * callback held the engine. The silence before every chunk was the model's
     * full pass over it, less whatever the sink had buffered, and on a phone
     * that was several seconds between paragraphs, charged for a table that
     * stripped to one line just as for a long one.
     *
     * Now a producer hands pieces to a channel and a consumer writes them,
     * and the producer may be [LOOKAHEAD_CHUNKS] chunks ahead of the one
     * being written. The model's pass over chunk N+1 happens while chunk N
     * plays, and as long as the model is faster than real time - it is, by a
     * comfortable margin on the device this was measured on - the gap is
     * gone. Memory is bounded by the lookahead: a chunk is at most a few
     * hundred characters, under thirty seconds of float audio.
     *
     * What is published follows the *listener*: [State.Speaking.chunkIndex]
     * is the chunk being written to the sink, not the one being composed,
     * so highlighting and skipping stay true to what is being heard.
     *
     * [askedAt] is when speech was asked for, so the wait before the first
     * sound can be measured rather than guessed at. A skip passes null: it
     * resumes an utterance whose first-audio time is already known.
