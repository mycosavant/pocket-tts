     * Pocket TTS has no speaker table: it is prompted with a few seconds of
     * reference audio and *samples* a speaker in that audio's neighbourhood.
     * The draw is a vector of Gaussian noise, and sherpa-onnx seeds it from a
     * random device on every sentence - not every read, every sentence, since
     * it re-splits whatever it is given on sentence-ending punctuation and
     * starts each one from a fresh generator. So a paragraph is read by a
     * succession of slightly different people, which is what "the voice keeps
     * changing" is.
     *
     * Pinning the seed makes that noise identical for every sentence, so the
     * same prompt yields the same speaker throughout - and, because the seed
     * is per-generation rather than per-anything-of-ours, on the system engine
     * as well as in the app.
     *
     * Off means a fresh draw each sentence, which is sherpa's own default and
     * worth keeping reachable: a fixed seed also fixes the reading, so the
     * same text always comes out identically, and someone re-reading a
     * paragraph to hear it differently wants the variation back.

     * repository - "Human evaluations consistently prefer the English model at
     * temperature 0.3 over the current default 0.7, and the change is free on
     * every objective axis we measured" - and this app followed them, because
     * shipping the wider default was not a decision anyone here made.
     *
     * Their 0.3 is recorded against english.yaml and english_2026-04.yaml, and
     * the bundle this app downloads is english_2026-01, so it is a strong
     * prior rather than a measured value for this exact snapshot. Hence a
