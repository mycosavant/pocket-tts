# Pocket TTS for Android

A native Android app that reads text aloud in Pocket TTS voices, entirely on the
device. No server, no network at speaking time.

It exists to remove a specific papercut: wanting to hear a paragraph in a good
voice and having to paste it into a notes app or a pastebin to get there.

## What it gives you

**A "Read aloud" item in the tap-and-hold text selection menu.** Select text
anywhere - a browser, a chat app, a PDF reader - and Pocket TTS appears in the
selection toolbar next to Copy and Share. Tapping it starts reading immediately
in a small floating window with pause and stop. This is an
`ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT` activity; apps that draw their own selection toolbar and
suppress the system one will not show it, and for those there is a share-sheet
entry as well.

**A system-wide text-to-speech engine.** Once Pocket TTS is selected under
*Settings → Accessibility → Text-to-speech output*, every app that already knows
how to read text uses these voices: Select to Speak, Chrome's read-aloud, ebook
readers, accessibility tools. None of them need to know this app exists. Audio
is streamed back chunk by chunk as it is generated, so playback starts after the
first sentence rather than the last one, and each chunk is announced with
`rangeStart` so callers that highlight along can.

Text arriving through the engine is **not** rewritten. It was chosen by another
app and is nearly always prose already; running it through the Markdown stripper
took asterisks out of ordinary sentences, reshaped `snake_case` identifiers, and
replaced links with nothing at all. An accessibility tool exists to say what is
on the screen, and quietly deleting a URL from that is a false account of the
content rather than a formatting choice. It is also what makes the offsets
meaningful: strip the text and they no longer point anywhere the caller could
highlight. The app's own screens still strip, because there the Markdown is the
user's own and reading it as prose is the point.

**A Markdown scratchpad.** Type or paste, hit speak. Markdown is stripped for
speaking, so `## Heading` is spoken as "Heading" rather than "hash hash
Heading", `**bold**` loses its asterisks, links are read as their text instead
of spelling out a URL, and code fences are skipped by default. Selecting a
passage in the editor and hitting speak reads just that passage, and the
sentence being spoken is highlighted as it goes.

**Any Pocket TTS voice, including your own.** Pocket TTS has no fixed speaker
table - a voice is a few seconds of reference audio the model conditions on - so
the stock voices and a wav you record yourself are the same kind of thing. The
voice picker lists the catalogue from
[`kyutai/tts-voices`](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices) and can import a
local wav. Each row plays a short sample, because twenty one names tell you
nothing about which one you want.

The sample is the voice's own reference audio rather than a synthesised
sentence. That is the most direct answer to "what does this sound like": the
reference audio *is* the voice. It also costs nothing but the prompt download -
no model bundle, no inference, no wait - so voices can be auditioned on a fresh
install before the 98 MB model has ever been fetched, and the download it does
is the same one selecting that voice would trigger later. The trade-off worth
knowing: it is the raw prompt, so it carries the recording's own room and
pacing. The synthesised voice tracks its timbre closely, which is the thing
being chosen, but not its background.

## Building

Requires JDK 17+ and the Android SDK (compileSdk 35, build-tools 35.0.0).

```bash
cd android
echo "sdk.dir=$ANDROID_HOME" > local.properties
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug        # or: gradle :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

The debug APK lands in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. It is about 60 MB, almost
all of it the ONNX Runtime and sherpa-onnx native libraries for `arm64-v8a` and
`armeabi-v7a`. Dropping `armeabi-v7a` from `abiFilters` in `app/build.gradle.kts`
roughly halves that if you only care about 64-bit devices.

## One install, however many things ask for it

Two callers reached the downloader independently - the button on the main
screen, and any read that arrived before the model existed - and neither knew
about the other. They shared a partial-download file and a staging directory, so
tapping Download and then selecting text in another app had them writing the
same `.part` and deleting each other's unpacked files.

The download also belonged to the activity that started it. A configuration
change cancelled the coroutine, but the transfer has no suspension point, so it
carried on headless while the recreated screen said "not downloaded" and invited
a second tap - and the partial was deleted on the way out, so that tap began
again from zero.

`engine/ModelInstall` owns one shared attempt. Everybody who asks joins the one
in flight, a screen that goes away leaves it running, and progress is a
`StateFlow` a recreated screen can pick up rather than something an activity
holds. Removing the sharing fails the test for it.

The download resumes. It is 98 MB; without a `Range` request a drop at 90 MB
throws away 90 MB, and on a connection that drops regularly it never finishes at
all - each attempt just gets a different distance through the same first
stretch. The partial now survives a network failure and is deleted only when the
archive turns out not to unpack, because that one is not worth resuming.

## Keeping the model, and the voices

Everything lives in internal storage, so uninstalling threw all of it away: a
98 MB download, and - the part that matters - every voice the user had recorded
or imported, which exists nowhere else. `android:hasFragileUserData` makes the
uninstall dialog offer to keep the data, which is the only way to offer that
choice at all.

Backup rules exclude the unpacked model and nothing else. Cloud backup allows an
app 25 MB, so including 200 MB of regenerable weights does not make a partial
backup - it makes a failed one, taking the settings and the voices down with it.
Those rules name the directory as a literal string because XML cannot reference
a Kotlin constant, so `BackupRulesTest` asserts the string still matches
`ModelManager.MODEL_NAME`. Renaming the bundle would otherwise break the
exclusion silently.

"Install from a file" takes the same `.tar.bz2` as the download, streamed
straight from the content URI - the unpacked model is already 200 MB and there
is no reason to want another 98 MB beside it. It is checked for the expected
ONNX files before anything is replaced, so pointing at the wrong archive leaves
a working install working.

## First run

The model is not in the APK. On first launch the app downloads
`sherpa-onnx-pocket-tts-int8-2026-01-26` - a 98 MB download that unpacks to
about 200 MB - into app storage. Voice prompts are a few hundred kilobytes each
and are fetched the first time each voice is used.

Inference runs on the CPU. Expect roughly real-time synthesis on a recent phone,
which the streaming design hides well for continuous reading but does mean a
short delay before the first words. It is not instant the way a small
concatenative engine is.

## How it works

```

                                      │      │

                                                                       sherpa-onnx
```

- `speech/MarkdownSpeech` turns Markdown into speakable prose.
- `speech/TextChunker` cuts it at sentence boundaries so the first audio arrives
  quickly and stopping is responsive.
- `engine/PocketTts` owns the single loaded model and serialises synthesis.
- `player/StreamingPlayer` writes float PCM to an `AudioTrack` with blocking
  writes, which back-pressures generation to the speed of playback.
- `player/PlaybackService` is a foreground service so reading survives the
  floating window being dismissed, and holds audio focus for as long as it is
  playing.
- `player/AudioFocus` asks the system for the right to be heard and gives it
  back. Without it the app read over whatever was already playing, a call did
  not pause it - muting the media stream during a call is at the vendor's
  discretion - and unplugging headphones carried on out loud from the phone's
  speaker. A transient loss pauses and resumes; a permanent one stops, because
  another app has taken over for as long as it likes and a paused reader nobody
  asked for helps no one. Ducking is declined: two voices at once are not two
  things you can listen to.

`MarkdownSpeech`, `TextChunker` and `WavReader` are plain JVM code and are
covered by unit tests in `app/src/test`.

## Saying the true thing while waiting

The model composes an entire sentence before it emits a single sample, so there
are several silent seconds between asking for speech and hearing any. The reader
reached `Speaking` when it started *working*, and every screen printed "Reading
aloud" through that silence - which is most of what the wait before the first
word actually feels like, and the reason it reads as broken rather than slow.

`Speaking.audible` is false until a sample has actually been written, and the
screens say "Composing the first sentence…" until it turns true. The wait did
not get shorter; it stopped being a lie.

## Following along

`Speaking` reports the character range of the chunk being read, but those
offsets are into the *stripped* text: stripping deletes syntax, so they drift
further from the document with every heading, link and asterisk passed.
`MarkdownSpeech.toSpeakableWithSource` records where each block came from, and
`Reader.spokenRangeIn` turns one into the other.

The map is per block, not per character - a block comes from a known run of
source lines, which is cheap to track. Within a block the range is narrowed to
the exact sentence when that sentence survived stripping unchanged, which is the
common case for prose; a rewritten line falls back to highlighting the whole
block, which is less precise but never wrong.

Everything hard about it is in the setup rather than the algorithm. Anything
that rewrites the string before the lines are counted silently shifts every
offset after it, so HTML comments are blanked with spaces of equal length rather
than removed, and line breaks are found by scanning rather than by normalising
CRLF to LF. Both have a test, and both tests fail if the normalisation comes
back. The CRLF one needed a second pass to be worth anything: the first version
used text that survived stripping unchanged, so the exact-sentence search
silently corrected the drift and the test stayed green against broken offsets.

## Two callers, one engine

There is a single model in the process and two things drive it: the in-app
reader, and the system text-to-speech service other apps call. `synthesize`
serialised them per *chunk*, so with both active they took turns sentence by
sentence and a passage came out read alternately in two different voices.
Neither side knew the other existed.

Serialising whole utterances instead would replace the alternation with a wait:
an app asking through Select to Speak would hang until a whole document finished
reading, which looks broken from the other side. So `engine/EngineTurn` makes
the most recent request win. A caller takes a turn before it starts and checks
it as it goes - per chunk and per audio callback, so a request arriving
mid-sentence does not have to wait out the rest of it. Finding the turn has
moved on means somebody asked more recently, and standing down is the only
thing that produces intelligible audio.

## The reader has one state machine, and it is testable

`Idle` used to mean two things - "nothing has been asked for" and "the read is
over" - so `stopLocked` published it between two utterances, and three screens
each kept a boolean to tell those apart. `StateFlow` conflates, so whether
anyone saw that transitional value was a race: the scratchpad overlay sometimes
failed to appear on a second Speak, and the foreground service sometimes
stopped and immediately restarted.

`Reader.State` now ends in `Finished`, `Stopped` or `Failed`, each carrying the
utterance it belongs to and who asked for it. The three flags are gone. Identity
matters as much as finality: the reader is process-wide, so a screen has to tell
its own read's ending from an earlier one it never asked for - the floating
window would otherwise close itself on stale news before its own read had begun.

`player/SpeechEngine` and `player/AudioSink` exist so this can be tested at all.
Before them, driving the reader meant a 98 MB model and an `AudioTrack`, which
is why the part that had actually been wrong had no tests - and why
`ActivityLaunchTest` reached `ensureModel` and quietly downloaded the model
bundle on every run of the unit suite.

Skipping is built on the same seam. An utterance keeps its chunks, its engine
and its loaded voice, so back a sentence costs that sentence and nothing else:
no re-selection, no reload. Back at the first sentence replays it; forward past
the last one ends the read, which is what someone who keeps tapping forward
means by it.

`GlassPanelViewTest` asserts the two things that were missing when the sliders
went dead: where the panel thinks it is relative to its backdrop, and what
colour it actually put on the canvas. Its predecessor asserted only that drawing
did not throw, and Robolectric's software canvas made the panel bail before it
ever reached the geometry - so the broken function was never called by any test.

`ActivityLaunchTest` drives every activity through its real lifecycle under
Robolectric, and forces a measure and layout pass at a realistic size. A theme,
a manifest entry and a layout can crash an activity just as easily as a function
can, and none of them are type-checked — one build shipped a theme that supplied
a decor action bar to screens that also called `setSupportActionBar`, and
another handed a Material `Slider` a value off its step grid. Both compiled,
packaged, and threw the instant the screen opened.

The layout pass is the part that earns its keep. Views validate themselves while
sizing, so reaching RESUMED proves very little: the slider bug passed a version
of these tests that stopped at `setup()`, because nothing had been laid out yet.

## The one thing here that cannot be fetched again

A model re-downloads and a setting is retyped in seconds. A voice somebody
recorded exists in one directory and nowhere else, so the failure worth
guarding against is not a crash but a quiet overwrite.

Imports used to share a directory with the downloaded prompts, so a wav named
`alba.wav` landed on exactly the path the stock Alba prompt is cached at,
replaced it, and then vanished from the list - because anything named like a
stock voice was filtered out of that list. One action, two losses, no message.

Imports now live in their own directory under `voices/imported`, and a name that
collides with a stock voice or an earlier import is suffixed rather than allowed
to win. Voices imported by an older build are carried across on first access;
one that was already named after a stock voice is indistinguishable from the
prompt it replaced and is left to be re-downloaded. `VoiceStorageTest` covers
all of it, and restoring the shared directory fails four of its six cases.

## Measuring before optimising

Inference is CPU-only and near real time, and every performance question about
this app turns on timings that cannot be measured here - no emulator, no device.
So `debug/Metrics` collects three numbers and the main screen shows them, with a
share button, the way the exit report does.

- **Time to first audio**, which is the wait everybody feels.
- **Generation speed on the first chunk**, before the buffer fills and blocking
  writes make every later measurement come out at exactly real time by
  construction. Below 1.0 means the model cannot keep up with its own playback.
- **Underruns**, which settle an open question. Synthesis blocks inside the
  audio callback, so sherpa-onnx cannot begin the next sentence until the buffer
  has drained to a couple of seconds; the prediction is a gap at every sentence
  boundary, fixed by putting a channel between synthesis and the audio track.
  That refactor is not written, deliberately. If underruns climb once per
  sentence the theory holds; if they stay at zero it does not, and the fix would
  have been a guess dressed as an improvement.

An unmeasured value reports "not measured yet" rather than a confident zero, and
`MetricsTest` enforces that. "0 underruns" from a session that never played
anything reads as evidence and is not.

## The voice, and why it kept changing

The voice used to change from sentence to sentence, and sometimes was not the
voice that had been selected at all. Three separate faults, all of which sound
identical from the outside.

**The speaker is drawn, and the draw was uncontrolled.** Pocket TTS has no
speaker table. It is prompted with a few seconds of reference audio and samples
a speaker in that audio's neighbourhood; the draw is a vector of Gaussian noise.
In `offline-tts-pocket-impl.h`:

```cpp
float temperature = gen_config.GetExtraFloat("temperature", 0.7f);
float stddev = std::sqrt(temperature);
int32_t seed = gen_config.GetExtraInt("seed", -1);
NormalDataGenerator normal_gen(0, stddev, seed);
```

That sits inside `GenerateSingleSentence`, which sherpa-onnx calls once per
sentence after re-splitting whatever text it is handed on `.!?`. Per *sentence*,
not per call. A seed of -1 means a fresh draw from a random device every time,
so a paragraph is read by a succession of slightly different people.

Both knobs travel in `GenerationConfig.extra`, an untyped string map. This app
passed nothing, so it got sherpa-onnx's defaults. It now sends both:

- **A fixed seed**, when "Keep one voice across sentences" is on, so every
  sentence draws the same speaker. It is the whole of that feature. An earlier
  attempt kept the last six seconds of generated audio and fed it back as the
  next sentence's prompt - which could not work, because it acted at chunk
  boundaries while the re-draws happen per sentence *inside* a chunk, and
  because replacing the prompt with generated audio abandons the selected voice
  entirely and never returns to it. That code is gone.
- **Temperature 0.3** rather than sherpa-onnx's 0.7. Kyutai moved English to 0.3
  in this repository (`d108410`): "Human evaluations consistently prefer the
  English model at temperature 0.3 over the current default 0.7, and the change
  is free on every objective axis we measured." Their default is recorded
  against `english.yaml` and `english_2026-04.yaml`, while the bundle this app
  downloads is `english_2026-01` - a strong prior rather than a measured value
  for this snapshot, hence a slider.

**A stock prompt could be somebody else.** An import named like a stock voice
overwrote that voice's wav, and `ensureVoice` treated any non-empty file at the
right path as cached - so nothing ever fetched the real one again. Every "Alba"
from that moment on was read in a different person's voice, silently, on every
build. `VoiceCatalog` now carries each prompt's exact size and a mismatch is not
cached. (The comment claiming these "will be replaced by a fresh download" had
been there the whole time. Nothing did it.)

**The system engine served a voice chosen weeks ago.** Android resolves an
engine's default voice name once per client and then sends that name back on
every subsequent request. Returning a concrete voice id from
`onGetDefaultVoiceNameFor` therefore pinned whichever voice was selected when
Select to Speak or Chrome first bound, and changing the voice here did nothing
for them until they were force-stopped. The engine now advertises one alias
voice, `selected`, resolved on each request.

## Who is actually speaking

`debug/VoiceTrace` records, per read: the voice asked for, the voice found,
whether that was a fallback, the prompt file's size against the size that voice
ships as, and then per chunk the prompt's length and content hash with the
temperature and seed in force.

```
[reader] asked for alba, got alba (958542 bytes as expected)
[chunk 0] alba prompt=9.98s hash=6f3a1c2e temp=0.30 seed=1
```

It exists because the faults above are mutually indistinguishable by ear and the
phone this runs on has no logcat within reach. Each line separates them: a
fallback names itself, a prompt that is not the one it claims to be shows a size
that does not match, a client sending a stale id shows a `requested` that is not
the selection, and a voice wandering with all of that correct is the draw. It
shares a screen with Timings, by the same reasoning as the exit report.

## Steps per frame, and a factor of five

`GenerationConfig.numSteps` is how many Euler steps the flow integration takes
for each generated frame. sherpa-onnx defaults it to 5. The reference
implementation defaults to 1 - in `lsd_decode` itself and again in
`default_parameters.py`. Four fifths of that work may be buying nothing, per
frame, on a phone.

Which it is cannot be settled from here, because one side of the trade is only
audible. So it is a slider on the main screen, next to Timings, and the default
stays at 5: at what has been shipping, not at a new guess. Move it, read
something long, and look at the generation speed.

How much time it can possibly buy is bounded, and worth knowing before reading
the number. The steps multiply one graph in the bundle - `lm_flow`, 10 MB - and
not the 76 MB `lm_main` that runs once per frame regardless. So the ceiling on
the saving is whatever fraction of a frame the small model accounts for, and
that fraction is exactly the thing nobody here has measured.

`docs/direct-ort.md` scopes what running these graphs ourselves would involve,
and starts from the same reading of the bundle.

## When it crashes

Sideloading onto a phone means no logcat within reach, and an app that dies
silently reports exactly one bit: "it crashed". `debug/CrashLog` writes the last
uncaught exception to app storage on the way down, and the next launch offers to
share it. It chains to the previous handler rather than swallowing the crash, so
the process still dies and the system dialog still appears - only the evidence
survives.

`CrashLog` alone cannot catch native crashes, ANRs or low-memory kills - none of
them unwind through the JVM - and those look identical from the outside to a
Kotlin exception. `debug/ExitReasons` closes that gap by reading the platform's
own record via `ApplicationExitInfo`, which names the kind of death and, for a
native crash on Android 12+, carries the tombstone. That reason code is the fact
that decides what to fix; the two sources are shown together on next launch.

## The JNI callback is not a lambda, on purpose

`PocketTts.audioCallback` wraps the streaming callback in an object expression
rather than passing a lambda. sherpa-onnx resolves that callback from native
code by name and exact signature - `invoke([F)Ljava/lang/Integer;`.

Kotlin 2.0 emits lambdas via `invokedynamic`, and D8 desugars them into
`$$ExternalSyntheticLambda` classes carrying only the erased
`invoke(Object)Object`. The specialised method is absent, `GetMethodID` returns
nothing, the JNI call proceeds with a pending exception, and the runtime aborts
the process. It surfaces as `REASON_CRASH_NATIVE` with no Java stack trace, from
code that is entirely ordinary Kotlin and compiles without a warning.

Nothing in Kotlin references that signature, so nothing in Kotlin breaks when it
disappears. `PocketTtsCallbackTest` asserts it by reflection and fails if the
callback becomes a lambda again.

It then disappeared a second time, by a different route. R8 inlined the
specialised method into its own bridge, leaving one method whose descriptor is
`(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;` - the reflective test still passed,
because it reflects over the unshrunk class. Release builds have no CheckJNI, so
instead of aborting they synthesised entire utterances into nowhere and reported
a failure after a long silence. Nobody noticed for a simple reason: CI built
only `assembleDebug`, so every APK ever sideloaded was a debug build.

`proguard-rules.pro` now keeps the method, and `tools/check-jni-callback.sh`
reads the built APK with `dexdump` and fails if no method declares that
descriptor. Both APKs are built and checked in CI, and both are uploaded, so
the shrunk build is something that gets installed rather than something that is
assumed to work. The source is not the artefact, and only the artefact knows.

## Glass, and where it cannot exist

Blurring depends entirely on what is behind the panel, and the two cases have
different answers.

Behind **another app**, only `Window.setBackgroundBlurRadius` can blur, because
an app may not read another app's pixels. Whether that works is not something to
reason about: `WindowManager.isCrossWindowBlurEnabled` answers it. On the device
this was built for it says no, and no value of any slider will produce a frost.

What it does not say is *why*, and this app no longer guesses. The system
withholds cross-window blur for battery saver, for Developer options →
"Disable window blur", and on devices whose vendor never enabled it. The frosted
panels the system draws for itself - Samsung's quick settings and app-drawer
folders, which are lovely - are composited by a privileged process and settle
none of it. Two of those three causes come and go, so the capability is followed
with `addCrossWindowBlurEnabledListener` rather than read once when the screen
opens.

The read-aloud sheet used to pretend otherwise. It drew a near-transparent
surface, found it could not blur, and painted a hard 0.94 instead - silently
overriding the opacity that had been dialled in, and looking like a blur that
had failed rather than like a decision. It is now an opaque Material card at the
bottom of the screen: bottom, because a centred dialog lands on the paragraph
that was just selected, which is the one thing the reader may want to keep
looking at. Where the platform genuinely supports cross-window blur it is
applied on top and the surface steps back to the tuned opacity - a bonus on the
devices that have it, not the design.

Behind **our own content**, `ui/GlassPanelView` gives a true
`backdrop-filter: blur()`: the blur is confined to the panel's own rounded
bounds and everything outside stays sharp. Each frame it records the backdrop
view into a `RenderNode`, offset so the slice behind the panel lands at the
panel's origin, hangs a blur `RenderEffect` on that node, and draws it clipped
to the panel - then the dim, then the tint, then the hairline. This works on any
Android 12 device with no vendor opt-in, so the scratchpad overlay is where the
glass lives.

That offset is the whole trick, and getting it wrong is silent. The panel has to
sit *outside* the backdrop - capturing an ancestor would draw the panel into its
own backdrop and recurse - so the backdrop is always a sibling. An earlier
version located the panel by walking *up* its parent chain looking for the
backdrop, which a sibling is never on: the walk ran off the top of the
hierarchy, the capture declined, and every panel fell back to a flat tint with
the configured opacity thrown away. The appearance sliders appeared to do
nothing, because for three of the four that was exactly true. Both views are now
located against the root they share and the difference is taken, which is
correct for siblings, cousins and ancestors alike.

The capture also has to start opaque, which is the second way this looked
broken. A backdrop view usually has no background of its own - it is letting the
window's background show through - so recording it captures its text on
transparency. Blur that, composite it, and the blurred copy lands *on top of*
the original, which is still there and still sharp underneath. Only the dim and
the tint appeared to do anything, and the panel read exactly like one whose blur
was not working.

That is why the appearance preview frosted convincingly while the real
scratchpad overlay did not: the preview's backdrop has a background and a row of
colour swatches, and the editor behind the overlay has neither. The panel now
fills the capture with the window background before drawing the backdrop into
it, so the blur has something solid to work on and the result covers what is
underneath instead of ghosting over it. Nothing about the backdrop's own layout
is required any more.

Because these failures have no visual signature - a panel that quietly gave up
looks like settings that were never wired - every frame records *why* it drew
what it drew in `lastDraw`, and the appearance screen prints it. A log line is
no use on a phone with no logcat within reach. It is worth saying that
`lastDraw` did *not* catch either of the two faults above: both reported
`BLURRED`, because the capture genuinely ran. It answers "did the blur path
execute", which is a narrower question than "did anything blur".

## The keyboard is not the window's problem any more

The scratchpad's Speak and Stop buttons sat under the keyboard. `adjustResize`
is in the manifest and does nothing: a window laid out edge to edge - which
`targetSdk 35` makes every window - is no longer resized when the keyboard
opens. It is handed the keyboard's size in the insets and expected to deal with
it. Nothing warns you, and the symptom is that reaching the control means
dismissing the keyboard you were typing with.

`ui/Insets` now pays back the maximum of the system bars and the IME, rather
than the system bars alone. The maximum and not the sum: the keyboard is drawn
over the navigation bar, so its inset already contains it, and adding them
leaves a gap exactly one navigation bar tall.

This is the technique [Haze](https://chrisbanes.github.io/haze/) uses on
Android. Haze is Compose Multiplatform and this app is Views, so the technique
is borrowed and the dependency is not.

`ui/AppearanceActivity` exposes opacity, blur, dim and corner radius as sliders,
because how this reads depends on the wallpaper-derived palette and the display
density - neither of which can be judged from source. Every label reports the
value in the form the source wants (`0.37f · alpha 94 · 37%`), and a button
copies the whole set as pasteable Kotlin. The defaults in `Settings` are the
values that came back from a device that way.

## Selecting text inside our own app

The `PROCESS_TEXT` item this app registers appears in the selection toolbar of
its own editor too, so selecting a line in the scratchpad opened the floating
window over the screen that already had controls for it - two sets of controls
for one utterance, in two different treatments, one of which could not frost.

`ReadAloudActivity` checks `callingPackage`: called from ourselves, it tags the
read as coming from the scratchpad, starts the service and finishes without ever
showing a window. The scratchpad claims any read tagged that way, whichever
route it arrived by.

## Edge-to-edge

`targetSdk 35` means Android 15 lays every window out edge to edge, so the
system bars are drawn over the content rather than beside it. `ui/Insets.kt`
pays those insets back as padding: each screen names the view that absorbs the
top inset (its app bar) and the one that absorbs the bottom. Without it the
toolbar wears the status bar and the first control is sliced in half.

## Licensing

Worth reading before shipping anything built from this.

- The ONNX export bundled by sherpa-onnx carries a
  [CC-BY-4.0 `LICENSE` file](https://huggingface.co/KevinAHM/pocket-tts-onnx),
  but its README states the export is for non-commercial use. Those two
  statements do not agree; treat the narrower one as binding until the exporter
  clarifies.
- Voices have individual licences, listed per voice at
  [`kyutai/tts-voices`](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices).
- Pocket TTS's own prohibited-use terms apply, in particular the ban on cloning
  someone's voice without their explicit and lawful consent. The import-a-wav
  feature makes that easy to do accidentally.

## Prior art

If you would rather not build anything:

- [NekoSpeak](https://github.com/siva-sub/NekoSpeak) (MIT) is an offline Android
  TTS engine that already supports Pocket TTS alongside Kokoro, KittenTTS and
  Piper, with voice cloning. It registers as a system engine but does not add a
  text-selection menu item or a scratchpad.
- [TTS Util](https://github.com/Danesprite/tts-util-app) (Apache 2.0) adds
  share-sheet entries and can read the clipboard through whichever system engine
  you have selected.
- [SherpaOnnxTtsEngineAndroid](https://github.com/jing332/SherpaOnnxTtsEngineAndroid)
  wraps sherpa-onnx as a system engine with in-app model downloads.

Pairing NekoSpeak (or this app's engine) with TTS Util gets you most of the way
without writing code; this app exists mainly to put all three pieces behind one
tap.
