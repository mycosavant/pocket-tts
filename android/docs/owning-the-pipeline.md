# Owning the pipeline, not the inference

A position, not a plan of record. Nothing here is built, and the next thing to
build is probably still nothing. It exists so that the question "should this be
one project instead of three" has a written answer to argue with.

`direct-ort.md` asks the Android-shaped version: should this app drive
`OrtSession.run` in Kotlin instead of going through sherpa-onnx. This asks the
wider one, and reaches a different answer about *where* the code should live.
Everything in that document about the bundle's contents and the frame loop holds
either way — it is the same graphs and the same arithmetic.

## The situation that prompts it

Three codebases currently run the same model:

| | what it is | how it reaches the model |
|---|---|---|
| this app | Android TTS engine + reader | sherpa-onnx C++ via JNI |
| [speech-kit-obsidian-plugin](https://github.com/mycosavant/speech-kit-obsidian-plugin) | Obsidian plugin | Rust adapter (`native/src/adapters/pocket_tts.rs`) over ONNX Runtime 1.23.2 |
| upstream `pocket_tts` | reference Python | PyTorch |

All three sound different, and until today nobody could say why. The answer
turned out to be one behaviour in sherpa's C++ that the two implementations do
not share, fixed from the caller's side. That fix is the reason this document is
worth writing rather than acting on: **the case for owning more of the stack got
weaker on the same day it got clearer.**

## What is actually owned, and what only looks owned

The honest inventory:

**Nobody here owns inference.** This app's inference is ONNX Runtime. speech-kit's
inference is ONNX Runtime. sherpa-onnx's inference is ONNX Runtime. That layer is
a commodity, it is Microsoft's, and no amount of rewriting changes which library
multiplies the matrices. A "Rust-core APK" would have had the same C++ under it,
one binding down.

**sherpa-onnx owns packaging, and it is years of it.** A C API, twelve language
bindings, a model zoo of a hundred-odd converted bundles, a build matrix reaching
Android, iOS, HarmonyOS, RISC-V and several NPUs, and the per-model preprocessing
that makes a `.onnx` file into something that speaks. That is the part it would
be foolish to reproduce and cheap to keep depending on.

**speech-kit owns the pipeline, and that is the valuable part.** Chunking,
voice management, streaming, cancellation, and a provider abstraction that lets
one front end speak through several engines. None of it is inference. All of it
is the difference between a model and a product.

So the thing worth owning is the middle: **the pipeline, not the inference.**

## The shape that follows

One Rust crate that *is* the product:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
                    │  core (Rust)                    │
                    │                                 │
                    │  text → chunks → speech → pcm   │
                    │  voices, cancellation, queueing │
                    │  trait Provider                 │
                    └──────────┬──────────┬───────────┘

    ┌─────────▼──────────┐                      ┌──────────▼─────────┐
    │ provider: direct   │                      │ provider: sherpa   │

    │ 1-2 models we care │                      │ the long tail      │
    └────────────────────┘                      └────────────────────┘

    shells:  JNI/AAR (this app) · napi/wasm (Obsidian) · CLI (Termux)
```

Three claims, in order of confidence.

**1. The pipeline belongs in one place, in Rust.** It is the code that is
currently written three times and behaves three ways. It has no platform
dependencies — text in, PCM out, plus a cancellation token — which is precisely
the shape that survives being called from JNI, from Node, and from a terminal.

**2. Direct ONNX Runtime is viable for a small, deliberate set of models.**
speech-kit's Pocket adapter is the existence proof: roughly 300 lines, and it
sounds better than sherpa did *because* of what it leaves out. One autoregressive
pass, no sentence splitting, no re-encoding the reference per sentence.
`direct-ort.md` reads the bundle graph by graph and finds nothing hidden — every
graph carries its state as ordinary tensors, so a direct driver needs no new
export, no PyTorch, and no changes to model files already downloaded.

**3. sherpa stays, as one provider among several.** Not as a fallback and not as
a stepping stone — as the answer for every model we are not going to hand-port,
which is all but one or two of them.

## The cost, stated plainly

**Anything run directly makes us the owner of model conversion and per-model
preprocessing.** That is exactly the labour sherpa performs for a hundred-odd
models, and it does not announce itself when it goes wrong. `direct-ort.md` names
the sharpest instance: the SentencePiece tokenizer is a Viterbi over a lattice —
a short function — surrounded by a normalizer, a whitespace convention and a
byte-fallback rule, and a tokenizer that is subtly wrong does not fail. It
mispronounces, occasionally, in ways nobody notices until someone reads a URL
aloud.

So the direct set must stay small and deliberate. One model. Possibly two. The
moment it becomes a policy rather than an exception, the project has quietly
signed up to be sherpa, without the contributors.

Three further costs worth naming:

- **A Rust core does not remove a dependency, it moves one.** ONNX Runtime is
  still there. The gain is that its surface becomes `Session::run` with tensors
  we own, instead of a generation loop we cannot see.
- **Three shells are three build systems.** An AAR with JNI, an N-API or WASM
  module, and a static binary — each with its own cross-compilation story, and
  Android's is the worst of them.
- **This app currently works.** Any migration is negative progress until the day
  it lands, measured against a baseline the owner can already hear.

## What today changed, and what it did not

The splitting fix stops sherpa-onnx cutting a chunk back into sentences and
generating each one independently. Two sentence-length bounds in the `extra`
map, set above `TextChunker`'s cap. Four lines. On the device: *"much better,
first syllable collapse is almost none."*

That matters to this decision in two directions.

**It weakens the performance case.** The largest audible gap between this app and
the reference implementation was not the binding, the language, or the inference
engine. It was one configuration decision in the C++, reachable from the caller.
A Rust rewrite would have inherited the same bug through the same C API and
needed the same four lines. Performance and quality are not currently arguments
for owning more.

**It strengthens the control case, slightly, by showing its shape.** The reason
it took a month to find is that the behaviour was invisible: no setting, no log,
no symptom except a voice that sounded wrong in a way nobody could name. The
argument for owning the pipeline was never that we would write a faster loop. It
is that a defect in code you own is a bug, and a defect in code you call is a
mystery.

But that is a weaker argument than speed, and it should be made to stand on its
own rather than borrowing speed's clothes.

## Where the models come from, which is not one place

Worth recording because it was assumed wrong once. The two projects do not share
a model supply chain:

- **sherpa-onnx** publishes pre-converted bundles as GitHub release assets under
  the `tts-models` tag. As of 2026-09-11 it publishes exactly two Pocket
  bundles, both `2026-01-26` — int8 and fp32 — and upstream's own C API example
  on master still points at the int8 one. Probed directly across every
  `2026-MM-DD` name from February to September; nothing newer exists.
- **speech-kit** resolves models from Hugging Face through its own
  `artifacts.json` manifest.

So `english_2026-04` is not a newer version of what this app runs. It is a
different package from a different place, without a Mimi encoder, because its
voices are precomputed embeddings from
`kyutai/pocket-tts-without-voice-cloning`. The encoder is what turns a recorded
wav into a voice. That bundle cannot clone one.

Two consequences:

1. **Model freshness through sherpa is an upstream constraint**, confirmed rather
   than assumed. Nothing to select today.
2. **A provider abstraction has to abstract the model source too**, not just the
   inference call. Whatever else is true, `ModelManager` should stop hardcoding
   an artifact name — a bundle descriptor with a stable default, a resolvable
   manifest, and an explicit-URL escape hatch. That is small, useful
   independently, and the one piece of this worth doing before any decision is
   made.

## How to decide

Not by argument, and not soon. In this order:

1. **Exercise what exists.** The Termux path has not been tested end to end. Do
   that before designing its replacement.
2. **Un-hardcode the model name.** One change to `ModelManager`, no strategy
   required, useful under every outcome.
3. **Build the tokenizer alone and diff it** against sherpa's tokenisation over a
   few thousand sentences. Highest risk, cheapest to abandon, and the same first
   step `direct-ort.md` names. If it does not agree, stop — everything
   downstream is arithmetic, but that part is judgement encoded in a file we do
   not have.
4. **Then extract the pipeline, not the inference.** If a Rust core happens, it
   should begin as chunking, voice management, streaming and cancellation behind
   a provider trait with *one* provider — sherpa — and no behaviour change at
   all. A migration that changes how it sounds on the same day it changes where
   the code lives cannot be debugged.

## What would make this not worth doing

- **sherpa keeps answering.** It has now yielded `numSteps`, `temperature`,
  `seed` and both sentence-length bounds to a caller willing to read the C++.
  The gap has narrowed twice in a week. If it narrows again, the control
  argument is gone.
- **The tokenizer does not agree**, per above.
- **Three shells turn out to be three projects.** The premise is that a Rust core
  makes one pipeline serve three front ends. If in practice each shell needs its
  own scheduling, its own audio session and its own error handling, the shared
  core is a header file with ambitions.
- **The app is good enough.** It is, currently. That is not a small thing, and
  "we own it" is not a feature anybody can hear.
