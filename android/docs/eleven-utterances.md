# Eleven Utterances

*End-to-end test results, 11-12 Sep 2026, build 52 verified on device.*

Testing the Termux -> Pocket TTS read-aloud path on the device for the first
time. Eight test cases, eleven reads. Everything that failed on first contact
was in the shell script or the proot environment - none of it in the app. The
four app defects found on the way were then traced against the engine's own
source and reproduced off the phone. The observations held; the explanation
for them did not. Both PRs are merged, and build 52 has now been run on the
phone: every fix confirmed, one item untested.

|---|---|
| Device | SM-S938U1 - Android 16 |
| Found on | build 46 - d7b66ae |
| Verified on | build 52 - merged main |
| Voice | alba - 958,542 bytes |
| Script fixes | [PR #7](https://github.com/mycosavant/pocket-tts/pull/7) - merged |
| App fixes | [PR #8](https://github.com/mycosavant/pocket-tts/pull/8) - merged |

## Verdict: the path works, the diagnosis needed the engine's source, and the device agrees

Transcript -> script -> broadcast -> `Reader` -> `PlaybackService` -> audio,
with a notification, lock-screen controls, and the screen off. The four
script bugs are fixed in #7. Three of the four app defects are fixed in #8
and the fourth was not a defect. Every fix has now been confirmed on the
phone. The headset "next" key remains untested.

## What the device showed on build 52

| Check | Build 46 | Build 52 |
|---|---|---|
| tail: `... One. Two. Three. Four. Five.` | stops after "Two." | full read |
| first audio, table-heavy piece | 4229 ms | 377 ms |
| generation speed | 0.83-1.38x | 2.29-3.41x |
| audible gap before a long paragraph | yes | none |
| audio underruns | 0-1 | 0 |
| stop in the collapsed shade | absent | present |
| stop on the lock screen | absent | present |
| headset "next" key | - | untested |

One prediction from the trace did not survive the listening. Chunks 4 and 5
of the boundary read showed `first=3879ms` and `first=2346ms`, which looked
like one-chunk lookahead running out on an uneven chunk - but there was no
audible gap. A larger chunk takes longer to produce its first sample, and
that time sits under the previous chunk's audio, which is exactly what the
producer/consumer split is for. `first=` is not silence.

## Status

| Test | Result | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 1 - script finds and extracts the reply | Pass | after fixing 1.1 |
| 2 - app reads a fixed string | Pass | after fixing 1.2 |
| 3 - `speak-last`, screen on | Pass | after fixing 1.3 |
| 4 - screen off, phone down | Pass | the case the receiver exists for |
| 5 - long reply, queued with `append` | Pass | 3 broadcasts, order kept, none dropped |
| 6 - transport controls | Pass | on build 52; headset key untested |
| 7 - Stop hook registration | Unblocked | held until 3.1 was safe - it now is |

The `. . . .` ellipsis case - flagged in the handoff as a live prediction
nobody had checked - is verified fixed on the device. Full length, clean,
correct inflection.

## Script bugs: 4 found, 4 fixed, merged in #7

All in `android/tools/speak-last.sh`. Patched in the installed copy first,
then verified again from the repo copy before the PR.

### 1.1 - `tail` from a pipe hangs under proot

The blocker - the script never reached the app. Unconditional, not
size-dependent, specific to `tail` reading stdin.

```
printf 'a\nb\n' | tail -1      ->  hangs forever (two lines)
tail -1 file                   ->  fine
cat file | head -1             ->  fine
cat file | awk 'END{print}'    ->  fine
```

Fixed with `awk 'END{print}'`. A second change dropped the `grep -v` in
favour of `select(length > 0)` inside jq - that part was optional. grep from
a pipe works fine; I misdiagnosed it before isolating `tail`.

### 1.2 - `am broadcast` needs an explicit `--user` on Android 16

```
SecurityException: Permission Denial: getIntentSender asks to run
as user -2 but is calling from uid u0a396; this requires
INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL or android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS
```

`-2` is `USER_CURRENT`. termux-am passes it by default and the platform now
refuses to resolve it from an app uid. `--user current` fails identically.
In #7 the id is `CLAUDE_TTS_USER`, default 0, so a work profile is not
stuck; the same flag is applied to `am start` in `pocket` mode, which was
not exercised on the device.

### 1.3 - Process substitution is broken under proot

```
speak-last.sh: line 143: /dev/fd/63: No such file or directory
Reading 1095 characters in Pocket TTS (0 broadcast(s)).
```

proot binds `/dev/fd` to the *reader's* `/proc/self/fd`, so the shell's fd
63 isn't there to open - the loop body never ran. The dangerous part is the
second line: it reported success while sending nothing. Fixed with a temp
file, and `sent=0` is now an error.

### 1.4 - Broadcast failures are invisible and the message misleads

```
am broadcast ... >/dev/null 2>&1 \
  || die "...am broadcast failed - is Pocket TTS installed?"
```

The `2>&1` swallowed the SecurityException in 1.2 entirely, and the message
sends the reader to check the install. The failure now prints the exception.

**What turned out to be true:** `am` cannot confirm delivery. It prints
`Broadcast sent without waiting for result` and exits 0 for a receiver that
does not exist *and* for a package that is not installed; it exits 1 only
when the platform refuses the broadcast outright. So "is Pocket TTS
installed?" was not just misdirected, it was undetectable from the script.
`Timings -> utterances read` is the only proof a read happened, and the doc
now says so.

## App defects: what the engine showed

The follow-up read `offline-tts-pocket-impl.h` from sherpa-onnx 1.13.6 - the
build the app ships - and ran that same engine off the phone: the same int8
bundle, the same Alba prompt, decode steps 1, temperature 0.3, the app's own
fixed seed among three, with Whisper base.en judging what came out. x86
numerics, so the exact seeds do not transfer to the device; the mechanisms
do.

### 3.1 - A run of short sentences at the end loses the tail — Fixed, verified on device

| Text | Tail | Build 46 | Build 52 |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... from Termux. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. | 5 runts | stops after "Two." | full |
| same, warm app | 5 runts | stops after "Two." | - |
| ... ordinary. One. ... Five. And this final ordinary sentence... | ordinary | full | - |
| ... plenty of audio to chew through. Done. | 1 runt | full | - |

Length is not the variable. Position is. Mid-text runts are harmless. One
trailing runt is harmless. A run of them loses the tail.

**What turned out to be true:** It is the model, not the reader. The engine
has no length for a chunk in advance: it runs the language model frame by
frame and stops when the model's own end-of-speech head crosses a
hard-coded threshold, plus three frames. On a trailing run of very short
sentences that head fires early, inside a single generation. Nothing in
`Reader` concludes anything; there was no wait to add.

| End of chunk | Whole, as shipped | Joined with commas |
|---|---|---|
| ... One. Two. Three. | lost "Three" 2/3 | full 3/3 |
| ... Patching. Testing. Done. | "done" twice 3/3 | full 3/3 |
| One. Two. Three. Four. Five. (alone) | lost "Five" 3/3 | full 3/3 |
| ... It compiles. Yes. | lost "Yes" 1/3 | full 3/3 |
| same runs, prose after them | full 4/4 | - |
| ... Done. (one short sentence) | full 4/4 | left alone |

The obvious alternatives were measured and rejected. Letting generation run
past the end-of-speech mark recovers nothing: after a real ending the model
does not fall silent, it repeats the last word - `five, five, five...` for
as long as it is allowed - so there is no silence to trim to. The reference
implementation pads very short inputs with leading spaces; sherpa-onnx
strips them before the model sees them, and padded and bare output were
identical to the sample. One generation per short sentence costs a full
voice-conditioning pass per word.

**The fix:** `TextChunker` gives each chunk a `speech` form in which a
trailing run of two or more sentences of two words or fewer is joined with
commas. What is shown and highlighted is untouched. Lists and headings are
already their own paragraphs, so this only touches prose that ends in a
countdown or a string of statuses - which is how agent replies end.

**Known limit, in the README:** the same head fires early inside an
ordinary sentence when it holds a run of numbers. `Tests 1, 2 and 3 are
green.` lost "green" in 2 of 3 runs; `Files A, B and C are updated.` never
did. The threshold is the engine's and the reference uses the same value;
nothing at the app layer can tell a premature end from a real one.

### 3.2 - Stop is missing from the notification and lock screen — Fixed, verified on device

No stop control visible at all. The handoff predicted exactly this: a
MediaSession custom action added in PR #4, and the control most likely to
be missing.

**What turned out to be true:** #4's custom action was correct and bought
no visible button. Two things draw the controls and both hid Stop. Before
Android 13 the notification's own actions are drawn, and the compact view
showed back, pause, forward - Stop was the fourth, dropped on the theory
that swiping the notification away already ends the read, which a media
notification for a read in progress cannot be. From Android 13 the system
draws the *session's* actions instead: previous, play/pause and next fill
the three collapsed slots, and a custom action appears only once the
player is expanded - which the lock screen cannot do.

**The fix:** the compact view is back, pause, stop; `Transport` no longer
publishes `ACTION_SKIP_TO_NEXT`, which hands that slot to the first custom
action, and that is Stop. Forward is a custom action in the expanded view,
and the headset's "next" key is taken in `onMediaButtonEvent`, because the
framework only routes it when the action is published.

**Confirmed on build 52:** back, pause and stop are the three drawn in the
collapsed shade and on the lock screen, forward appears once expanded, and
stop ends audio and notification together. The headset "next" key was not
tested - Bluetooth was off for the audio work and a false negative was not
worth the risk.

### 3.3 - Skip forward terminates the read — By design, relabelled in #8

Pressed after skip back and several pause/resume cycles, near the start of
the second sentence. Audio and notification ended together - the outcome
stop should have produced, from the wrong button.

**What turned out to be true:** Not one bug with 3.1, and not a bug. A skip
moves by chunk, and a chunk is a paragraph or up to about 400 characters of
one, cut at sentence ends. The test text was one chunk, so forward from its
second sentence was forward past the last chunk, which ends the read by
design - and starts the next queued piece, if there is one. The buttons
said "a sentence"; they never moved by one. They now say "Skip back" and
"Skip forward", and the docs say what a chunk is. A skip finer than a chunk
would need the engine to give audio back per sentence, and it composes a
chunk whole.

### 3.4 - A stripped table costs a four-second silence — Fixed, verified on device

```
[agent] ...                       <- queue piece 2, mostly a markdown table
[chunk 0] ... first=4229ms        <- against 786ms for piece 1
```

**What turned out to be true:** `first=` is not priming. It is the model's
entire pass over the chunk. `GenerateSingleSentence` runs every frame of
the language model over a chunk before the decoder produces a sample, then
hands audio back in pieces of just over a second. So the number scales with
the chunk, and a chunk that is one stripped table row still pays one full
pass. That alone would only delay; the pipeline change below is what made
it a silence.

**On build 52:** the same heading-table-paragraph text gave *time to first
audio: 377 ms* against 4229 ms, and the table is dropped silently with no
audible pause before the paragraph behind it.

### 3.5 - Generation speed is marginal on this device — Fixed, verified on device

Across eleven reads: 0.83x to 1.38x real time. The app flagged the low one
itself - `generation speed: 0.83x real time - slower than playback`.

```
[chunk 0] alba prompt=9.98s ...
```

**What turned out to be true:** The reader fed the speaker from inside the
engine's callback, and the write blocks when the buffer is full. So chunk
N+1 could not begin until chunk N had been *heard*: the silence before
every paragraph was the model's full pass over it, less about two seconds
of buffer. Underruns could not see that, because a track that is simply not
written to between chunks is not "running dry" in a way that counts. And
the 0.83x figure was measuring the speaker as much as the model: it timed a
call that spent most of its length waiting on playback. Back-solved, the
model itself runs at roughly 1.4-4x real time on this device.

**The fix:** `Reader.play` is now a producer and a consumer. The engine's
callback drops pieces into a channel, a writer feeds the sink, and the
producer may be one chunk ahead of the one being written - bounded by a
semaphore on chunks, not a bounded channel, because the engine's callback
cannot suspend and a callback blocked waiting for room would hold the
engine exactly as the blocking write did, with nothing to wake it after a
stop. Published state follows the listener, not the engine. `generation
speed` now measures the engine alone, and underruns now mean one thing: the
model fell behind real time.

**On build 52:** `generation speed` read 2.29x and 3.41x on the same texts
that gave 0.83-1.38x before - bracketing the back-solved 1.4-4x estimate.
Underruns stayed at 0.

## What was done

1. **Upstream the four script fixes.** [#7](https://github.com/mycosavant/pocket-tts/pull/7), plus the finding that `am` cannot confirm delivery.
2. **Compose the next chunk while the current one plays.** Closes 3.4 and 3.5. Three new `ReaderTest` cases pin the pipeline: the second chunk reaches the engine while the first is still being written and the third does not; a stop writes nothing composed ahead; a failure on chunk two arrives after chunk one's audio.
3. **End a chunk where the model can.** `TextChunker.speech` joins a trailing run of short sentences. Closes 3.1 as observed; the numbers-in-a-sentence limit is documented, not fixed.
4. **Put Stop in the collapsed controls on both paths.** Closes 3.2.
5. **Say what the skip buttons do**, in their labels and in both docs. 3.3.

All in [#8](https://github.com/mycosavant/pocket-tts/pull/8): 236 unit tests and lint green locally and in CI. Both PRs merged; build 52 run on the phone.

## Still open

- **The headset "next" key.** `ACTION_SKIP_TO_NEXT` is no longer published, so the key is taken in `onMediaButtonEvent` instead - untested, because Bluetooth was off. If Stop draws correctly but the key does nothing, the slot was freed and the handler did not land; report those separately.
- **Test 7, the Stop hook.** Held until 3.1 was safe to hit on every reply. It now is, so registering it is a one-line change to `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- **`CLAUDE_TTS=pocket`**, the `am start` activity path. #7 applies `--user` there too, unexercised.
- **A genuine >32,000-character reply.** The queue was exercised by lowering `CLAUDE_TTS_LIMIT` to 400, which is the same code path.
- **Numbers inside an ordinary sentence.** Documented as an engine-level limit, not fixed. `Tests 1, 2 and 3 are green.` is the reproduction.
