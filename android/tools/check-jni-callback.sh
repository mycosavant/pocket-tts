# Fails if a built APK is missing a method pocket-speak's engine finds by name.
#
# rust/crates/android resolves these from native code, so nothing in Kotlin
# breaks when they disappear:
#
#   - NativeEngine's native methods, which the loader binds to the exported
#     Java_org_pockettts_android_engine_NativeEngine_* symbols by name;
#   - Sink.onAudio, which the engine calls per chunk with
#     call_method(sink, "onAudio", "([F)Z").
#
# R8 renaming or inlining any of them compiles cleanly and passes every test.
# Under sherpa-onnx its audio callback vanished twice that way, by two
# different mechanisms. The only place the answer exists is the built
# artefact, so that is what this reads. Usage:
#
#   tools/check-jni-callback.sh app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
#
